GUB Transport Pass is a digital solution designed to simplify and modernize the university transport pass system for Green University of Bangladesh (GUB) students.

âœ… Securely log in using their Student ID  
âœ… Select or change their preferred bus route  
âœ… Apply for or renew their transport pass every semester  
âœ… Recover lost credentials with email/OTP verification  
âœ… Display a digital QR/Barcode pass for onboard validation
